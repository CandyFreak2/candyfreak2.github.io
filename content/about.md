Hello! I'm Jerry Kaufman, currently a student at Champlain College, where I've been studying for a B.S Game Programming degree with a minor in mathematics. Where I'm currently specializing in Systems and Tools development. I really enjoy getting to develop pipelines and systems that are cross-discipline friendly. Whether that's creating documentation/resources for other team members to follow regarding version control, or systems that would allow making things as comprehensible and flexible so that the project can benefit from varying skill levels. 

Throughout my time at Champlain College, I have gained experience in Unity and Unreal Engine, in recent projects have found myself gravitated towards Unreal Engine due to their extensive software and the desire to learn more in terms of their blueprints system but also on the backend with C++. 

In my free time, I like to develop other side projects like Nameless Heroes, play video games, some of my all time favorites being Firewatch for the visuals, and the Horizon Series for their deep and engaging narrative through worldbuilding.
