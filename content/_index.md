Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm Jerry, a junior Systems and Tools Programmer with a specialization in Game Dev. I enjoy getting to architecture, design and develop systems with the purpose of creating a viable product that can be used across disciplines.

I am currently a senior at Champlain College, graduating in May 2026. As of May, I will have a bachelor of science degree in game programming and a mathematics minor.
